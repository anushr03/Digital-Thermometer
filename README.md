# Digital-Thermometer
Using a TMP36 Sensor, calculated the temperature of the room in Farenheit and displayed it to a 4 digit 7 segment display. With the help of the push button, converted the temperature to Celcius and displayed that to the 4 digit 7 segment display as well.

The project was made as an assignment for the course ECE231- Intro to Embedded systems. The course was taken in Spring22 at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The professor was Dr. David McLaughlin.
